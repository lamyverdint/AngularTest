  <h3>What is it ?</h3>
  <p>
    Back in 2017, I was a clueless student who didn't know anything about programming language.
    The purpose of this project was to learn Java language in a funny way: by creating a "sort of" video game.
    I knew what I did was bad but seeing it 4 years later, in early 2021, I can see how <b>bad</b>
    (no vulgarity) it really is and how embarassing that is. Even the "website" is horrible.. Well, I'm going to delete it anyway.

  <h3>Storyline</h3>
  <p>
    Hiso Dius is a 23 years old man living in Valladolid, in México. Interested in History and curious in nature, he loves to travel around
    South America to discover new cultures, way of living, traditions and legacies from the past. <br>
  </p>

  <p>
    One day, one of his closest friend's mother calls him because the latter, Dante, got sick and acts really weird after visiting
    <b><i>El Castillo</i></b>, the <b>Temple of Kukulcán</b> in Chichén Itzá. She called doctors but they don't know anything about this
    sickness. She is really worried for his son and don't know what to do anymore. Hiso thus decides to pay a visit to Dante.

    He is quite shocked after seeing his friend: he has a high fever and keeps yelling nonsense about the said temple he visited. Dante's
    mother thinks this is some sort of curse and plead with Hiso to find a cure or anything to lift the curse. <br>
    Suspecting something might have happened during his visit in El Castillo, the young man decides to venture into the temple.
